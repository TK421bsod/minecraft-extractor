# minecraft-extractor

This is a small Python script that extracts Minecraft's sound files.
It only works on Windows for now.

# Usage
Using this is pretty simple. You only need:
- Python 3.7+
- Minecraft installed in its default directory

Once you have those, just run extractor.py and follow the prompts.
